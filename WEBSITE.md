# Website Building Skill

## Overview
This skill defines a standardized vanilla HTML/CSS/JS structure for building websites. The goal is consistency across all projects: same folder structure, file naming, and minimal but helpful comments.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Minimal Comments Philosophy
- **95% code, 5% comments** — keep files clean and readable
- One short comment block at the **top** of each file explaining purpose
- Sparse section headers in code (`/* Hero Section */` or `// Navigation Menu`)
- **Goal:** Under 5 comment lines per file total
- Only add explanatory comments for truly complex logic

### 2. Consistent File Structure
Every project uses the exact same folder hierarchy and naming conventions:

```
project-root/
├── index.html          # Main landing page
├── overview.md         # Project documentation (purpose, colors, quick edits)
├── assets/             # All media files
│   ├── images/         # Photos, graphics, backgrounds
│   ├── fonts/          # Custom web fonts
│   └── icons/          # SVG icons, favicons
├── styles/             # CSS only
│   └── styles.css        # Primary stylesheet
├── scripts/            # JavaScript only
│   └── main.js         # Primary script file
└── pages/              # Additional pages
    ├── about.html
    ├── contact.html
    └── [other-pages].html
```


## The overview.md File

**Important:** The `overview.md` file is **provided by the user**, not generated by the agent. This file contains information about the site, company, purpose, and design preferences.

### User's Responsibility
The user will create and provide the initial `overview.md` with information such as:
- Company/project background
- Site purpose and goals
- Target audience
- Brand guidelines (colors, fonts, tone)
- Key features needed
- Any specific requirements

### Optional Research Enhancement
The user may ask the agent to **research and expand** the overview.md file before building:

```
"Before building the site, research [company/topic] and add more details 
to overview.md including: competitor analysis, industry trends, 
best practices for [industry] websites, etc."
```

After research, the agent updates overview.md with findings, then proceeds to build.

### Example overview.md Structure
```markdown
# [Project Name]

## Company Background
[User provides or agent researches company info]

## Site Purpose
Brief description of what this site does

## Target Audience
Who will use this site

## Brand Guidelines
- **Primary Color:** #hex
- **Secondary Color:** #hex
- **Font:** [Font Name]
- **Tone:** Professional/Casual/Modern/etc.

## Key Features Needed
- Hero section with CTA
- Contact form
- Product showcase
- etc.

## Design Notes
- Mobile breakpoint: 768px
- Accessibility requirements
- Performance targets
```

### Workflow Options

**Option 1: User provides complete overview.md**
```
User: [uploads overview.md] "Build the website based on this overview"
Agent: [reads overview.md] → builds site
```

**Option 2: User provides basic overview.md + requests research**
```
User: [uploads overview.md] "Research more about [topic] and expand 
the overview before building"
Agent: [researches] → updates overview.md → builds site
```

**Option 3: User provides minimal info, agent researches first**
```
User: "Research [Company X] and create an overview.md, then build their site"
Agent: [researches] → creates overview.md → confirms with user → builds site
```

## Additional Folders

The structure above covers **core website files**. Project-specific needs get their own folders:

- `data/` — JSON files, mock data, content files
- `docs/` — Documentation, guides, specs
- `components/` — Reusable HTML snippets
- `lib/` — Third-party libraries if not using CDN

**Keep it simple:** Only add folders when actually needed. Don't create empty "just in case" directories.

## Agent Instructions

When building a website using this skill, use the following prompt structure:

```
Build a [type] website using this exact vanilla structure:

project-root/
├── index.html
├── overview.md
├── assets/ (images/, fonts/, icons/)
├── styles/ (styles.css)
├── scripts/ (main.js)
└── pages/ (additional .html files)

Requirements:
1. Add ONLY simple top comments per file (purpose + 2-3 key edit areas)
2. Use section headers like /* Hero Section */ or <!-- Navigation -->
3. No line-by-line comments or long explanations
4. Keep under 5 comment lines per file
5. Create overview.md with project purpose and key editable areas
6. All images go in assets/images/
7. Single CSS file: styles/styles.css
8. Single JS file: scripts/main.js
```

---

## File Naming Conventions

### HTML Files
- `index.html` — main landing page
- `about.html`, `contact.html`, `services.html` — lowercase, descriptive
- Use hyphens for multi-word pages: `privacy-policy.html`

### CSS/JS Files
- `styles.css` — primary stylesheet
- `main.js` — primary script
- If additional files needed: `utilities.css`, `animations.js` (descriptive, lowercase)

### Asset Files
- **Images:** Lowercase with hyphens: `hero-background.jpg`, `profile-photo.png`
- **Icons:** `icon-name.svg` format
- **Fonts:** Keep original font file names

---

## Benefits of This Structure

### For Learning
- **Clarity:** Open any file, read first 3 lines, understand purpose
- **No Clutter:** 95% actual code means focus on learning, not reading comments
- **Predictable:** Same structure every time = faster navigation

### For Collaboration
- **Consistency:** Anyone can jump into any project instantly
- **Maintainability:** Clear sections make updates easy
- **Scalability:** Structure handles small sites to larger projects

### For AI Agents
- **Reproducible:** Same structure every build
- **Clear Instructions:** Minimal but sufficient guidance
- **Fast Generation:** No need to invent new structures

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Don't Do:**
- Line-by-line comments explaining obvious code
- Multiple CSS/JS files for simple sites
- Mixing styles in HTML (`<style>` tags)
- Inline JavaScript (`onclick` attributes)
- Deeply nested folder structures
- Inconsistent naming (camelCase mixed with hyphens)

✅ **Do Instead:**
- Trust developers to read code
- Single CSS/JS file unless project demands more
- Keep all styles in `styles.css`
- Keep all scripts in `main.js`
- Flat, organized folder structure
- Consistent lowercase-with-hyphens naming

---

## Summary

This skill ensures every website built follows the same clean, minimal, predictable structure. Perfect balance for learning without clutter, maintaining without confusion, and building with AI agents that need clear, consistent patterns.

**Key Takeaway:** Simple structure + minimal comments = maximum clarity.
